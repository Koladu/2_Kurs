winternl.h -- This module defines the internal NT APIs and data  structures that are intended for the use only by internal core. Windows components.  These APIs and data structures may change  at any time. These APIs and data structures are subject to changes from one.  Windows release to another Windows release.  To maintain the  compatiblity of your application, avoid using these APIs and  data structures. The appropriate mechanism for accessing the functions defined in  this header is to use LoadLibrary() for ntdll.dll and  GetProcAddress() for the particular function.  By using this approach, your application will be more resilient to changes  or these functions between Windows releases.  If a function  prototype does change, then GetProcAddress() for that function   might detect the change and fail the function call, which your  application will be able to detect.
